Define & provide examples of confounding \r\n2. Describe methods for assessing the presence of confounding\r\n\r\n\r\n### Recall?\r\nthat the whole purpose of epi studies is to determine the “truth” about the association  between “predictors” and health outcomes \r\n\r\n### But?\r\n* what happens when there is another plausible explanation for the outcome that also happens to be associated with the “predictor” of interest?\r\n* This is what we mean by ___confounding___! \r\n\r\n### What factors can cause study results to be inaccurate?\r\n* Chance – could ___random error___ explain the observed association between predictor and outcome?\r\n* Bias – could ___systematic error___ have produced spurious results?\r\n* Confounding (or third variables) – could we be wrongly attributing the effect of one predictor to a different predictor that is not the true cause?\r\n\r\n### Confounders\r\n* When looking at whether a health outcome is associated with a particular predictor of interest, it may also be associated with some other predictor\r\n* This other predictor may be associated with both the predictor of interest and the outcome under study\r\n* Such a variable is called a confounder\r\n\r\n### Alcohol drinking, tobacco smoking, and lung cancer\r\n* A cohort study reveals that people who drink alcohol have a 5 times greater incidence of lung cancer than do non-drinkers. \r\n* Should we thus conclude that there is a strong relationship between drinking alcohol and lung cancer?\r\n\r\n### Not necessarily!\r\nEven if we’ve addressed issues of random error and bias, we still need to rule out confounding before we can conclude that an apparent association is real.\r\n\r\n### Assessing Confounding\r\n* Could the observed association be explained by the presence of another predictor aside from the predictor of interest?\r\n* To answer, we must know two things:\r\n* (1) - what are the known and highly suspected risk factors for the disease under study? \r\n* (2) - Do our groups differ in their histories of exposure to these other risk factors? \r\n\r\n### Other risk factors for lung cancer…\r\n* 1. Are there other known or highly suspected risk factors for lung cancer?\r\n* What about smoking?\r\n* 2. Do some drinkers smoke and some non-drinkers not smoke?\r\n* Of course!!\r\n\r\n### Confounding of alcohol drinking by smoking:\r\n* Most of our drinkers are also smokers, but few of our non-drinkers smoke.\r\n* So we must adjust for __smoking__ in the analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
