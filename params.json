Define & provide examples of confounding \r\n\r\n2. Describe methods for assessing the presence of confounding\r\n\r\n\r\n### Recall?\r\nthat the whole purpose of epi studies is to determine the “truth” about the association  between “predictors” and health outcomes \r\n\r\n### But?\r\n* what happens when there is another plausible explanation for the outcome that also happens to be associated with the “predictor” of interest?\r\n\r\n* This is what we mean by ___confounding___! \r\n\r\n### What factors can cause study results to be inaccurate?\r\n* Chance – could ___random error___ explain the observed association between predictor and outcome?\r\n\r\n* Bias – could ___systematic error___ have produced spurious results?\r\n\r\n* Confounding (or third variables) – could we be wrongly attributing the effect of one predictor to a different predictor that is not the true cause?\r\n\r\n### Confounders\r\n* When looking at whether a health outcome is associated with a particular predictor of interest, it may also be associated with some other predictor\r\n\r\n* This other predictor may be associated with both the predictor of interest and the outcome under study\r\n\r\n* Such a variable is called a confounder\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
