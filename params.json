Define & provide examples of confounding \r\n2. Describe methods for assessing the presence of confounding\r\n\r\n\r\n### Recall?\r\nthat the whole purpose of epi studies is to determine the “truth” about the association  between “predictors” and health outcomes \r\n\r\n### But?\r\n* what happens when there is another plausible explanation for the outcome that also happens to be associated with the “predictor” of interest?\r\n* This is what we mean by ___confounding___! \r\n\r\n### What factors can cause study results to be inaccurate?\r\n* Chance – could ___random error___ explain the observed association between predictor and outcome?\r\n* Bias – could ___systematic error___ have produced spurious results?\r\n* Confounding (or third variables) – could we be wrongly attributing the effect of one predictor to a different predictor that is not the true cause?\r\n\r\n### Confounders\r\n* When looking at whether a health outcome is associated with a particular predictor of interest, it may also be associated with some other predictor\r\n* This other predictor may be associated with both the predictor of interest and the outcome under study\r\n* Such a variable is called a confounder\r\n\r\n### Alcohol drinking, tobacco smoking, and lung cancer\r\n* A cohort study reveals that people who drink alcohol have a 5 times greater incidence of lung cancer than do non-drinkers. \r\n* Should we thus conclude that there is a strong relationship between drinking alcohol and lung cancer?\r\n\r\n### Not necessarily!\r\nEven if we’ve addressed issues of random error and bias, we still need to rule out confounding before we can conclude that an apparent association is real.\r\n\r\n### Assessing Confounding\r\n* Could the observed association be explained by the presence of another predictor aside from the predictor of interest?\r\n* To answer, we must know two things:\r\n* (1) - what are the known and highly suspected risk factors for the disease under study? \r\n* (2) - Do our groups differ in their histories of exposure to these other risk factors? \r\n\r\n### Other risk factors for lung cancer…\r\n* 1. Are there other known or highly suspected risk factors for lung cancer?\r\n* What about smoking?\r\n* 2. Do some drinkers smoke and some non-drinkers not smoke?\r\n* Of course!!\r\n\r\n### Confounding of alcohol drinking by smoking:\r\n* Most of our drinkers are also smokers, but few of our non-drinkers smoke.\r\n* So we must adjust for __smoking__ in the analysis\r\n\r\n### After adjusting for smoking…\r\n* Crude RR=5, Adjusted RR=1.2, so\r\n* …after controlling for smoking, there is very little evidence for a relationship between alcohol and lung cancer \r\n* In other words, alcohol seemed to cause lung cancer, but only because of  confounding by tobacco\r\n\r\n### Rule of Thumb\r\n* When the adjusted measure of effect is far different than the crude measure of effect, we can conclude quite confidently that the predictor  for which we adjusted is a confounder.\r\n\r\n### It was also noted that…\r\n* popcorn consumption was higher among drinkers than non-drinkers\r\n* So, let’s control (standardize) for popcorn as a possible confounder in the alcohol-lung cancer relationship. \r\n* After adjusting for popcorn consumption, we get an RR of 1.3 as compared to the crude RR of 5. \r\n* So is popcorn a confounder?\r\n\r\n### Is eating popcorn really associated with lung cancer?\r\n* Well, the crude and adjusted RRs are very different.\r\n* However, in order for an exposure to qualify as a confounder, three conditions must be met…\r\n\r\n### Three Conditions for Confounding\r\n1. The potential confounder must be associated with the predictor of interest\r\n2. The potential confounder must be associated with the outcome of interest\r\n3. The potential confounder must NOT be on the hypothesized causal pathway between the exposure and the outcome\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
