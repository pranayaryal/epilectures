<ol>
<li>Define &amp; provide examples of confounding </li>
<li>Describe methods for assessing the presence of confounding</li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a id="recall" class="anchor" href="#recall" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Recall?</h3>

<p>that the whole purpose of epi studies is to determine the “truth” about the association  between “predictors” and health outcomes </p>

<h3>
<a id="but" class="anchor" href="#but" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>But?</h3>

<ul>
<li>what happens when there is another plausible explanation for the outcome that also happens to be associated with the “predictor” of interest?</li>
<li>This is what we mean by <strong><em>confounding</em></strong>! </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="what-factors-can-cause-study-results-to-be-inaccurate" class="anchor" href="#what-factors-can-cause-study-results-to-be-inaccurate" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What factors can cause study results to be inaccurate?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Chance – could <strong><em>random error</em></strong> explain the observed association between predictor and outcome?</li>
<li>Bias – could <strong><em>systematic error</em></strong> have produced spurious results?</li>
<li>Confounding (or third variables) – could we be wrongly attributing the effect of one predictor to a different predictor that is not the true cause?</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="confounders" class="anchor" href="#confounders" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Confounders</h3>

<ul>
<li>When looking at whether a health outcome is associated with a particular predictor of interest, it may also be associated with some other predictor</li>
<li>This other predictor may be associated with both the predictor of interest and the outcome under study</li>
<li>Such a variable is called a confounder</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="alcohol-drinking-tobacco-smoking-and-lung-cancer" class="anchor" href="#alcohol-drinking-tobacco-smoking-and-lung-cancer" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Alcohol drinking, tobacco smoking, and lung cancer</h3>

<ul>
<li>A cohort study reveals that people who drink alcohol have a 5 times greater incidence of lung cancer than do non-drinkers. </li>
<li>Should we thus conclude that there is a strong relationship between drinking alcohol and lung cancer?</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="not-necessarily" class="anchor" href="#not-necessarily" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Not necessarily!</h3>

<p>Even if we’ve addressed issues of random error and bias, we still need to rule out confounding before we can conclude that an apparent association is real.</p>

<h3>
<a id="assessing-confounding" class="anchor" href="#assessing-confounding" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Assessing Confounding</h3>

<ul>
<li>Could the observed association be explained by the presence of another predictor aside from the predictor of interest?</li>
<li>To answer, we must know two things:</li>
<li>(1) - what are the known and highly suspected risk factors for the disease under study? </li>
<li>(2) - Do our groups differ in their histories of exposure to these other risk factors? </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="other-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer" class="anchor" href="#other-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Other risk factors for lung cancer…</h3>

<ul>
<li>1. Are there other known or highly suspected risk factors for lung cancer?</li>
<li>What about smoking?</li>
<li>2. Do some drinkers smoke and some non-drinkers not smoke?</li>
<li>Of course!!</li>
</ul>

<a id="confounding-of-alcohol-drinking-by-smoking" class="anchor" href="#confounding-of-alcohol-drinking-by-smoking" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Confounding of alcohol drinking by smoking:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Most of our drinkers are also smokers, but few of our non-drinkers smoke.</li>
<li>So we must adjust for <strong>smoking</strong> in the analysis</li>
